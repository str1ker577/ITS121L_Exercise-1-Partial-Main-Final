<p style="font-family: sans-serif; color:#24AC88; font-size: larger;">The BMW 5 comes in multiple variants in an attempt to satisfy as many buyers as possible. These variants include but are not limited to: the base 5 series, the 530e, the M550i, the M5 Competition and lastly, the M5 CS.</p>

    <p style="font-family: sans-serif; color:#24AC88; font-size: larger;">The 2022 BMW 5-Series is equipped with a broad array of engines that provide smooth power whenever you need it. The base powertrain is a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 with 248 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. For more ferocious performance, there’s a plug-in hybrid powertrain consisting of the same turbo inline-4 above plus an electric motor and lithium-ion battery. The combination produces 288 total system horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque.

        The 5-Series can also be fitted with a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 for more power and torque (335 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque). If that’s not enough, consider the high output 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8 that develops 523 horsepower and 553 lb-ft of torque. Should you need a faster response for superior performance in demanding applications, we’d recommend the M5, which offers the same twin-turbo V8 but raises output significantly higher to 600 horsepower. With the M5 Competition, you get slightly more power at 617 hp, from the same twin-turbo V8. The same engine produces 627 horsepower in the M5 CS.
        
        The BMW 5-Series comes standard with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Rear-wheel drive is standard; all-wheel-drive is available.</p>

    <p style="font-family: sans-serif; color:#24AC88; font-size: larger;"> The 2021 BMW 530e is part plug-in hybrid, part luxury car, and part sports sedan. If that seems like a restaurant menu item that's attempting to marry too many styles of cuisine into one dish, know this: The 530e blends its trio of disparate elements into a capable and tasty whole. It's even fun to drive, which is not something we've said often about BMW's non-M-badged sedans in recent years.</p>

        <p style="font-family: sans-serif; color:#24AC88; font-size: larger;">Set a mere rung below the M5, the M550i wears a body kit that makes it look nearly as aggressive as the M5, but crammed into the 5-series's engine bay is the detuned version of the BMW's 4.4-liter V-8. An eight-speed automatic is the only transmission, and it works brilliantly, delivering crisp shifts that largely go unnoticed and responding quickly to accelerator inputs. The engine has big lazy power and 553 pound-feet of torque to push you into the 20-way leather seats.</p>

        <p style="font-family: sans-serif; color:#24AC88; font-size: larger;">Some cars are big-bodied and some are thrilling. The BMW M5 is both, with a body based on the regular 5-series and a heart-and-lung transplant courtesy of the brand's M performance division. Under the hood lives a spectacular 600-hp twin-turbo V-8 bolted to an eight-speed automatic transmission that powers all four wheels. An optional Competition package turns up the heat with 17 extra horsepower, a more soulful exhaust, stiffer suspension, and Competition badging and trim. That version rocketed to 60 mph in 2.8 seconds in our testing. Built to handle the rigors of mountain hairpins, blasts on the autobahn, and everyday life the M5 offers a premium experience with a penchant for fireworks.</p>

        <p style="font-family: sans-serif; color:#24AC88; font-size: larger;">To make the most of the lighter M5, BMW wrung 10 extra horsepower out of the Competition's twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8. With 627 horsepower and 553 pound-feet of torque churning through a ZF eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive, the M5 CS posts a 2.6-second time to 60 mph and a quarter-mile speed of 130 mph in 10.6 seconds. The trans pops off shifts and shows its commitment in its most race-car-like mode as it slots itself into the right gear under braking to give you what you need for the corner.</p>
