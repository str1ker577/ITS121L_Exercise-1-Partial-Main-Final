<!-- Pargraph 1 and 2, General Information-->
<h2 style="color:#24AC88;"> <bold>General Information:</bold></h2>
    
    <p style="font-family: sans-serif; color:#24AC88; font-size: larger;"> The seventh generation of the BMW 5 Series consists of the BMW G30 (sedan version) and BMW G31 (wagon version, marketed as 'Touring') executive cars. The G30/G31 has been produced since 2016 by the German automaker BMW and is often collectively referred to as the G30. It was officially announced on 12 October 2016 and sales began in February 2017.[6]

        The fastback 5 Series Gran Turismo model from the previous generation is no longer part of the 5 Series model range, and has been moved to the 6 Series Gran Turismo nameplate.[7] A long-wheelbase sedan version (model code G38) is sold in China.
        
        On 27 May 2020, a facelifted 5 Series was unveiled. Although the 2021 BMW 5 Series is 1.2 inches longer than the 2020 model, many of the vehicle's other dimensions remain unchanged despite the styling redesign.[8]
        
        In 2023, the G30 5 Series is expected to be phased out in favor of the G60 5 Series. </p>

    <p style="font-family: sans-serif; color:#24AC88; font-size: larger;">The first generation of 5 Series was powered by naturally aspirated four-cylinder and six-cylinder petrol engines. Following generations have been powered by four-cylinder, six-cylinder, V8 and V10 engines that are either naturally aspirated or turbocharged. Since 1982, diesel engines have been included in the 5 Series range.

        The 5 Series Touring was unveiled in February 2017[14] before making its public debut in March at the Geneva Motor Show.[15]

<!--Paragraph 5 and 6, Equipment -->
<h2 style="color:#24AC88;"><bold> Equipment</bold></h2>
<p style="font-family: sans-serif; color:#24AC88; font-size: larger;">Compared with its F10 predecessor, the G30 includes an updated BMW iDrive system with a higher resolution 10.25-inch display, a new heads-up display that covers 70% more area as well as selective anti-dazzle high beam headlights with a range of up to 500 metres.[27] The 5 Series is also available with gesture control, new multi-contour massage seats, and a Driving Assistant Plus package that features lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control, a lane centralizing and vehicle following system and a collision warning system.[28] 520-545 models with the M Sport trim and M550 models can be fitted with M Performance Parts.

<p style="font-family: sans-serif; color:#24AC88; font-size: larger;">At launch, the G30 is available in two equipment lines: Luxury Line and Sport Line, with the M Sport models becoming available in March 2017.[29] The main differences of these lines are color availability (for example, the M Sport models have Carbon Black metallic instead of Jet Black), wheel designs, as well as exterior and interior stylings. The Sport Line has been discontinued during the 2021 facelift.</p>

<h3 style="color:#24AC88;"><bold> Laser Headlights</bold></h3>
<p style="font-family: sans-serif; color:#24AC88; font-size: larger;">BMW laserlight headlights are high-beam technology that not only delivers a brighter beam but adapts to the environment. Laser headlights function by using three small blue lasers pointed at a set of mirrors in the front of the headlight system. The mirrors focus the laser light into a lens filled with yellow phosphorus. Yellow phosphorus when excited by the blue laser emits an intense white light.</p>

<br>

<h3 style="color:#24AC88;"><bold> Luxury Line</bold></h3>
<p style="font-family: sans-serif; color:#24AC88; font-size: larger;">In the Luxury Line, the car carries a classic luxury look with high-gloss chrome finish on exterior elements like the Air Breather vent, the radiator grille, the lower air intakes and the side windows surrounds. Inside, leather upholstery is standard, while the instrument panel is trimmed in Sensatec leatherette as standard. The dashboard as well as the door cards are trimmed in "Ridge" fine-wood finish as standard with other wood finishes available as an option. Standard wheels are 18-inch W-spoke or 19-inch multi-spoke wheels.</p>

<br>

<h3 style="color:#24AC88;"><bold> Sport Line</bold></h3>
<p style="font-family: sans-serif; color:#24AC88; font-size: larger;">In the Sport Line, the sporty character of the car is emphasized with high-gloss black finish on the Air Breather vent, the radiator grille slats, the lower air intake and side windows surrounds. Inside, combination cloth/leather upholstery is standard, with leather available as an option. The dashboard and door cards are trimmed in high-gloss Black with Pearl Chrome accents with other trims available as an option. Standard wheels are 18-inch 10 double-spoke or 19-inch V-spoke wheels. This line was discontinued after the June 2020 facelift for model year 2021.</p>
